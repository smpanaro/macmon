Experimental fork for M4 Macs (macOS 15.2 Sequia) using Histogram Bins for memory bandwidth.
Original fork: https://github.com/smpanaro/macmon

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This fork adds _experimental_ support for rendering memory bandwidth. I'm pretty sure I chose the correct metrics, but it's possible I did not.
(These are no longer exposed through powermetrics so there is no official tool to check against. If you know of one, let me know.)

## Motivation

Apple Silicon processors don't provide an easy way to see live power consumption. I was interested in this information while testing local LLM models. `asitop` is a nice and simple TUI to quickly see current metrics, but it reads data from `powermetrics` and requires root privileges. `macmon` uses a private macOS API to gather metrics (essentially the same as `powermetrics`) but runs without sudo. 🎉

## 🌟 Features

- 🚫 Works without sudo
- ⚡ Real-time CPU / GPU / ANE power usage
- 📊 CPU utilization per cluster
- 💾 RAM / Swap usage
- 📈 Historical charts + avg / max values
- 🌡️ Average CPU / GPU temperature
- 🎨 Switchable colors (6 variants)
- 🪟 Can be rendered in a small window
- 🦀 Written in Rust

## 🍺 Install via Homebrew

```sh
brew install vladkens/tap/macmon
```

## 📦 Install from source

4. (Optionally) Binary can be moved to bin folder:

```sh
sudo cp target/release/macmon /usr/local/bin
```

## 🚀 Usage

```sh
Usage: macmon [OPTIONS] [COMMAND]

Commands:
  raw   Print raw metrics data instead of TUI
  help  Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)

Options:
  -i, --interval <INTERVAL>  Update interval in milliseconds [default: 1000]
  -h, --help                 Print help
  -V, --version              Print version

Controls:
  c - change color
  v - switch charts view: gauge / sparkline
  q - quit
```
